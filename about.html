        <h3>A little more about this website...</h3>
        <p>This website serves as my sandbox and journal for weekly hacks. These hacks are for my own personal development and entertainment as I explore various different technologies, languages, frameworks, etc. I'm a novice (everyone's gotta start out from somewhere right?), but I want to get better, so I'm creating this website to declare myself to the world and hold myself accountable for <b>delivering something every week</b> no matter big or small!</p>

        <p>I also like Disney, Pixar, cartoon characters a lot, so I'm going to name each of my hacks one of these characters. Wohoo. We'll see what I can come up with. Here's to surprises!</p>

        <h3>A little more about me...</h3>
        <p>I recently graduated from college, am passionate about tech, ultimate frisbee, being outdoors, and trying new things. My current goal in life is to be able to apply tech to make the world a better place. I know that's broad, but I do have some causes in mind, just need to get myself a bit more grounded.</p>

        <p>So yeah. That's all I can think of now. Feel free to shoot me a <a href="mailto:lindading5@gmail.com">message</a> if you have something cool that you want to share with me.</p>
