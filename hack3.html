          <p>One-Liner: Building project with Ant</p>
          <p>Notable Tech: Apache Ant</p>
        </div>

      <h3>Concept:</h3>
      <p>Last week two weeks (week <a href="hack1.html">1</a>, <a href="hack2.html">2</a>), I created a Java object-oriented project dealing with multithreads in a MVC framework. And this week, I was curious about automating builds. I looked into Apache Ant and Maven, and decided to try Ant, because Ant requires a more refined approach to the build, while Maven seems to do many aspects of it for you (which is great! Don't get me wrong. But for my purpose, I want to learn/ try the itty-bitty parts).</p>

      <p>In addition, I've worked with Ant before, but on the side of, "oh. ok. this project is an ant project, and to run it do these x, y, z commands. Ok. I'll just trust this Ant magic to do what I want".<p>

      <h3>Product:</h3>
      <p>This week, I didn't touch/ refactor any of the Java code, but added/ played with the build.xml for Ant (also installed Ant with Homebrew).

      <h3>Tech Specs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Java code from two weeks (week <a href="hack1.html">1</a>, <a href="hack2.html">2</a>) </li>
        <li>Apache Ant for builds</li>
        <li>Git branch (got more familiar)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
      <p>Ant builds turn out to be a lot easier than I thought. Configuring the build file was pretty straight forward. I find the build.xml file to be very neat, because the dependencies and the xml format all comes together (under this Ant magic) very well. I do have to say it was a little tedious to set it up, but once that's up and running, it was very easy and efficient for me to clean/compile/build/run the project!</p>

      <h3>Future/ if-I-have-more-time:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Maybe Apache Maven?</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>ps. Why Rabbit? Keeping with the Winnie the Pooh theme (since same project), Rabbit seems to be the one that does the building the most (his garden) compared to all the other characters.
