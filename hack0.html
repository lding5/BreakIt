      <h3>Concept:</h3>
      <p>For the past year or so, I got to learn more about tech. It not only has been surprising me in every turn, but also inspiring me to try new things and see what I can build. Since then, I've been jolting down notes on things that I want to learn, cool ideas to implement, etc. But I never really took a good hard step to plunge into it and implement it, because school was simply busy enough for me already. But now that I'm out of school (at least for the time being), I have some downtime to really explore and play with tech! I wanted a starting conglomerate point, where I can keep all my projects and reflections, and so this is it.<p>

      <h3>Product:</h3>
      <p> This week was pretty this site is up and running, so it's successfull in the end. yay!</p>

      <h3>Tech Specs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Static web pages = HTML, CSS, JS/ JQuery</li>
        <li>CSS Framework = Twitter Bootstrap</li>
        <li>Code repo/ Version control = Git/ GitHub</li>
        <li>Deploy = Amazon AWS S3, Route 53</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
      <p>Overall, this was a very nice warmup to get me started and a lot more excited about what I'm about to do.</p>

      <p>I'm pretty comfortable with web dev (HTML, CSS, JS/ JQuery), so it wasn't too frustrating to put this website together.</p>

      <p>Deploying this though, was something that I learned to do this week. There are several different ways that I could've done this by, such doing this on an actual server or Heroku. But I don't have a personal server that I can use, maybe a raspberry pi project later on. And as for Heroku, I didn't go this route because I wanted someone to take care of the infrastructure for me right now, since I wanted to get this website up and running first. So later, I'll play with Heroku. So I ended up with Amazon AWS.</p>

      <p>To be honest, when I first started to look at Amazon AWS, it was quite daunting. There's so many options and it was overwhelming. But thankfully, Amazon provided very helpful and easy-to-follow tutorial links. In the end, I got a S3 and Route 53 (took me a while to think of what I want to name my site) set up with multiple mouse clicks and tadah, there it is all up and running! So yeah, a pretty good experience with that so far.</p>

      <h3>Future/ if-I-have-more-time:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make this website buffer. Add some tag options. Put in a database to organize all this info?
        <li>My code also lives in github, and I want to find a way to easier integrate it with AWS. So I'll be playing with AWS Elastic Beanstalk later on. But S3/ static pages will do for now.</li>
        <li>Other Amazon's options! There's so many to try</li>
        <li>Rasperberry Pi</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>ps. Why Jack-Jack Parr?
        Because like my project, this is my lovely but scary baby. All of this could easily go up in flames or not. Anything can happen. So we'll see where this goes!</p>
