      <h3>Concept:</h3>
      <p>I decided to take a break from Java and that string of Honey projects, so wanted to jumpship and try something completely different. This past year, I've heard a lot about developing an app completely using Javascript from the back-end to the front-end, and I've been intrigued with it for a long time.</p>

      <p>I am very comfortable with and love using Javascript/ JQuery on the front-end, because it brings a webpage to life! Many cool tricks you can do with it- I think I will do a week more on experimenting with other cool JQuery functionalities. Also, I've done quite a bit of web development before and have learned/ played with various languages for each layer. Though it's cool to learn all these languages and their different intricacies/ concepts, it wasn't easy in the beginning to learn them all and string them together. So with this concept of using Javascript for the whole stack, I'm curious to see how it all works.</p>

      <h3>Product:</h3>
      <p>This week, I successfully installed an instance of mongoDB to my local machine, and was able to log into it. Then, I just played with the databases, collections, finds/ updates/ inserts/ deletes, etc. So yeah, nothing much to video-show you this time around. Sorry.</p>


      <h3>Tech Specs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Installed mongoDB</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
      <p>First, it was really easy to install MongoDD, get the server/ client up and running, and log in. </p>

      <h3>Future/ if-I-have-more-time:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a middle layer. Look into connecting it first with Java</li>
        <li>Incorporating things like: Node.js, Angular.js, maybe some javascript unit testing, JAVASCRIPTLAND!</li>
        <li>Explore other JQuery functionalities</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>ps. Why the Tree from Bug's Life? I figured since mongoDB's symbol is a leaf, this tree is the closest leaf-like (very leaf like ;) ) pixar object that I could think of.</p>
