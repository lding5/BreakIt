      <h3>Concept:</h3>
      <p><a href="hack1.html">Last week</a>, I created a Java project dealing with multithreads, written in an object-oriented perspective. This week, I wanted to that this project one more level up, and decided to refactor it, so it's written in a MVC framework.<p>


      <h3>Product:</h3>
      <p>When refactoring last week's code into a MVC framework, I didn't use Eclipse, but rather coded everything by hand to make myself learn the specifics. 

      <h3>Demo:</h3>
    <video id="sampleMovie" src="hack2Demo.mov" class="demoVideo" preload controls></video>

      <h3>Tech Specs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Java code from <a href="hack1.html">last week</a>, refactored into a MVC framework</li>
        <li>Java GUI Swingx</li>
        <li>Git branching</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
      <p>I have worked with MVC frameworks before, but not entirely on my own, and usually with Eclipse/ not from scratch. So I started this project by following a tutorial and looking up a lot of references that helped me import the right Java classes to get this framework to work. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, because I had to rethink and reorganize the code to fit into an MVC structure. Also, I can see how having this framework is especially useful and needed in larger projects, because it modularizes and organizes the code in a structured manner.</p>

      <p>Also, I've worked with Java Swingx before, and working it this week reminds me of how much of a hassle I still think it is... Haha. Well. I decided to use Java Swing to provide a quick and easy way to create a View for my MVC. I could've easily used JSPs, but since I haven't used Swingx for a while, I decided to refresh my memory with it and give it another try. But yeah, Java Swingx seems to requires so many lines of code to simply put an element in the GUI, and doesn't even look that good- at least the way it is right out of the box. 

      <h3>Future/ if-I-have-more-time:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How about adding an eclipse ant build to it?!</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>ps. Why Mrs. Kanga? Because MVC framework requires writting the code in a division of labor format, which Mrs. Kanga would be one of the best characters in Winnie the Pooh to have the wisdom and command to do this.</p>
